### Definition of “Done”
A task or feature is considered **done** when:
- The implementation meets the requirements mostly, I am not expecting it to be fully correct because of AI being used.  
- Code is clean, readable, and documented where necessary  
- Relevant tests or validation steps are done (if applicable)   

---

### Pull Request Expectations
- PRs should be **small and focused** on a single change or feature  
- Include a description of *what* things has changed  
- Ensure the code builds/runs without errors  
- Open to providing and giving feedback and iteration before merging  

No direct commits to the main branch—**all changes go through PR review**.
