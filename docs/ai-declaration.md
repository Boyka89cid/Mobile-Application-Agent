For our project, we will try to omit the usage of AI tools as 
long as possible since we are providing context to AI 
thought prompting to build the application for us. So, one in our case using AI would not be beneficial 
and will be used only to a limited extent. We expect to use ChatGPT that would
be verified by checking various prompts we have written and various tools
doesn't exactly match their output rather that it is based upon human
intelligence.
