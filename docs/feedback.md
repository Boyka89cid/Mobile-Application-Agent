## Feedback from mentor

### Week 2

The mentor emphasized that the primary priority should be setting up and stabilizing the development environment before expanding features, which shifted the focus away from broad functionality toward building a solid foundation. Due to these environment-related constraints, the project scope was intentionally reduced to avoid generalizing across multiple datasets or schemas, instead concentrating on a single, well-defined HR schema. This is excpected to expand as we learn. As a result, a key technical decision was made to standardize on Python as the core language for development, ensuring shared familiarity, and smoother collaboration.
