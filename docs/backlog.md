PROBLEM STATEMENT

The end user for this project is any organization that wants to manage employee databases automatically, without knowledge of the coding required to support the databases, or without manually doing it on the dashboard. 

Our team is interested in using AI to make HR tasks easier and less time consuming for organizations. A lot of employee management systems are complicated and require technical knowledge or manual work through dashboards. Even though LLMs are powerful, they usually give very general answers and can’t safely interact with company databases on their own. We want to build this AI agent that works on top of existing models and uses tools to manage employee data in a more controlled and personalized way. 

This software helps by letting users manage employee information through simple natural language instead of complex dashboards or technical tools. The AI agent handles repetitive HR tasks automatically by using structured tools and company specific context, reducing manual work and errors. The system makes it safer for organizations to let AI interact directly with their data.
