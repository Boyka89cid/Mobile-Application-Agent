# Mobile-Application-Agent

A repository for building Agent that can build an application dynamically.
This will include the usuage of already exists MCP server which could be 
taken from GitHub site, [MCP servers](https://github.com) or building and maintaining a new MCP servers so to allow
dynamic changes in the flutter/react-native application. Since, developing this kind of server will be new 
because of new tools, prompts and resources required to train LLM, and no one yet has provided
to give a server like this till now. 

__Target User:__ This product will be used by the client looking fpr
an AI agent to develop the basic functionality of the application, 
like rendering a screen correctly, adding and changing the RestAPI calls,
adjusting the requirements according to the user requirement and many
more tools can be added.

__Risk__: One risk we agree cannot ignore is AI/LLM agent capable
of devlering all the different functionalites. To resolve this problem
we may add Agent-to-Agent [A2A google](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/a2a-a-new-era-of-agent-interoperability/) 
protocol.

__Team members (TM) roles__ (No team members has joined yet)

**TM-1 initial role**: Find out the relevant information about what
kind of language is popular or being used nowadays to get an 
application quickly working. To my knowledge it would be flutter or 
react native. Having some familiarity with the language would be useful
because we have to do prompting afterward.

**TM-2 initial role**: Find and read out the relevant information 
about the MCP servers and already existing tools that are required 
to build the application. Also find out what tools are not 
available so that we can enhance the functionality of LLM by providing
tools to LLMs.

**TM-3 initial role**: Help setting up the environment required 
for development of resources like choosing language, choosing 
backend database required for the servers to run, etc.

**TM-4 initial role**: Define constraints, safety mechanisms, fallback strategies,
and monitoring for agent behavior in production-like environments.
